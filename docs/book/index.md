# Introduction

## What is Neo4j?

Neo4j is a native graph database, built from the ground up to leverage not only data but also data relationships. Neo4j
connects data as itâ€™s stored, enabling queries never before imagined, at speeds never thought possible.

## Why was Neo4jphp created?

This package was created because we use Neo4j for our software. At Shareforce we follow strict
guidelines and expect our code to be up to par with the latest technologies. At the time of writing this library, there
were only outdated libraries. In packagist the libraries were either abandoned or no longer maintained (as in, support
for PHP 5.3).
